simpegEM1D
==========

simpegEM1D is a geophysical simulation and inversion software for an
electromagnetic (EM) geophysical surveys. Particularly it is designed to
handle inducitve loop source with a single receiver coil or magnetometer.
A main interest of the package is hanndling airborne EM survey, which
can quickly map electrical conductivity of the subsurface at large area.
This package is under an opensource geophysical simulation and inversion software,
SimPEG's ecosystem
